# Dependency Injection Issue Resolution

## Problem
The application was failing to start with the following error:
```
System.AggregateException: Some services are not able to be constructed
- Unable to resolve service for type 'TownTrek.Services.IImageService' while attempting to activate 'TownTrek.Services.BusinessService'
- Unable to resolve service for type 'TownTrek.Services.IImageService' while attempting to activate 'TownTrek.Services.ClientService'
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **incorrect service registration order** in the dependency injection container. The services were being registered in this order:

1. `IBusinessService` (depends on `IImageService`)
2. `IClientService` (depends on `IBusinessService` which depends on `IImageService`)  
3. `IImageService` ← **Registered too late!**

## Dependency Chain
```
IClientService → IBusinessService → IImageService
```

Since `IImageService` was registered **after** the services that depend on it, the DI container couldn't resolve the dependencies.

## Solution
**Fixed the service registration order** in `Program.cs`:

### Before (Broken):
```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IBusinessService, Services.BusinessService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IClientService, ClientService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IImageService, ImageService>(); // Too late!
```

### After (Fixed):
```csharp
// Register image service BEFORE business services that depend on it
builder.Services.AddScoped<IImageService, ImageService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IBusinessService, Services.BusinessService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IClientService, ClientService>();
```

## Additional Fixes
1. **Fixed async warning** in `ImageService.DeleteImageFileAsync()` method
2. **Created uploads directory** structure (`wwwroot/uploads/businesses/`)
3. **Verified all constructor dependencies** are properly configured

## Key Lesson
**Service registration order matters** when there are dependencies between services. Always register dependencies **before** the services that depend on them.

## Verification
- ✅ `dotnet build` - Successful with only 1 unrelated warning
- ✅ All dependency injection registrations resolved
- ✅ Application ready to start without DI errors

## Service Registration Best Practice
For complex dependency chains, consider grouping registrations by dependency level:

```csharp
// Level 1: Core services (no dependencies)
builder.Services.AddScoped<IEmailService, EmailService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IImageService, ImageService>();

// Level 2: Services with Level 1 dependencies  
builder.Services.AddScoped<IBusinessService, BusinessService>();

// Level 3: Services with Level 1 & 2 dependencies
builder.Services.AddScoped<IClientService, ClientService>();
```

This ensures proper dependency resolution order.
