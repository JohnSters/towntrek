## Observations

1. **Duplicate Files**: Some files appear in multiple folders (e.g., Register.cshtml, Login.cshtml, ForgotPassword.cshtml in both Auth/ and Home/)
2. **Complex Forms**: The largest files are business-related forms with extensive functionality
3. **Placeholder Pages**: Several client pages are very small (18 lines), suggesting they may be placeholder content
4. **Admin Focus**: Admin views are substantial, indicating robust administrative functionality
5. **Subscription Management**: Dedicated folder for subscription tier management with comprehensive CRUD operations

## Current Issues Analysis

### 🚨 Major Structural Problems

1. **Inconsistent Organization**: Admin functionality is split between `Admin/` and `AdminSubscription/` folders
2. **Missing Index Files**: Some folders lack `Index.cshtml` files for consistent navigation
3. **Duplicate Files**: Authentication views exist in both `Auth/` and `Home/` folders
4. **Inconsistent Naming**: Mix of singular and plural naming conventions
5. **Poor Separation of Concerns**: Public and authenticated views mixed together
6. **Missing Subfolder Structure**: Complex areas like business management lack proper suborganization

### 📊 Current Structure Problems

| Issue | Impact | Severity |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Split Admin Views | Confusing navigation, poor UX | High |
| Missing Index Files | Inconsistent routing patterns | Medium |
| Duplicate Auth Files | Maintenance overhead, confusion | High |
| Inconsistent Naming | Developer confusion | Medium |
| Mixed Public/Auth Views | Security concerns, poor organization | High |
