# Partial View Location Fix

## Problem

The EditBusiness view was throwing an `InvalidOperationException` because it couldn't find the partial views:

```
The partial view '_CategorySpecificSectionsEdit' was not found. The following locations were searched:
/Views/Business/_CategorySpecificSectionsEdit.cshtml
/Views/Shared/_CategorySpecificSectionsEdit.cshtml
```

## Root Cause

The issue was with ASP.NET Core's partial view resolution logic:

1. **EditBusiness action** is in `BusinessController` (not `ClientController`)
2. **BusinessController** serves the view from `/Views/Client/Businesses/EditBusiness.cshtml`
3. **Partial view resolution** searches relative to the controller name first:
   - `/Views/Business/` (controller name)
   - `/Views/Shared/` (shared location)
4. **Our partial views** were located in `/Views/Client/Businesses/`

## Solution

Moved all category-specific partial views from `/Views/Client/Businesses/` to `/Views/Shared/`:

### Files Moved:
- `_CategorySpecificSections.cshtml` → `/Views/Shared/`
- `_CategorySpecificSectionsEdit.cshtml` → `/Views/Shared/`
- `_MarketSection.cshtml` → `/Views/Shared/`
- `_TourSection.cshtml` → `/Views/Shared/`
- `_EventSection.cshtml` → `/Views/Shared/`
- `_RestaurantSection.cshtml` → `/Views/Shared/`
- `_AccommodationSection.cshtml` → `/Views/Shared/`

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **Universal Access**: Partial views in `/Views/Shared/` can be accessed by any controller
2. **Reusability**: These partial views can now be used by other controllers if needed
3. **Consistency**: Follows ASP.NET Core conventions for shared components
4. **Maintainability**: Single location for all category-specific form sections

## Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Use full path in partial calls**: `@await Html.PartialAsync("~/Views/Client/Businesses/_CategorySpecificSectionsEdit", Model)`
   - ❌ Less maintainable, hardcoded paths

2. **Move partials to `/Views/Business/`**: 
   - ❌ Would break AddBusiness form (served by ClientController)

3. **Move EditBusiness to ClientController**:
   - ❌ Would require larger refactoring

## Verification

- ✅ Build succeeded with no errors
- ✅ All partial views now accessible from both BusinessController and ClientController
- ✅ Both AddBusiness and EditBusiness forms should work correctly

## Controller Structure

```
BusinessController (Controllers/Business/)
├── EditBusiness (GET/POST)
└── Serves: ~/Views/Client/Businesses/EditBusiness.cshtml

ClientController (Controllers/Client/)
├── AddBusiness (GET/POST)  
└── Serves: ~/Views/Client/Businesses/AddBusiness.cshtml

Shared Partials (/Views/Shared/)
├── _CategorySpecificSections.cshtml (for Add)
├── _CategorySpecificSectionsEdit.cshtml (for Edit)
├── _MarketSection.cshtml
├── _TourSection.cshtml
├── _EventSection.cshtml
├── _RestaurantSection.cshtml
└── _AccommodationSection.cshtml
```

The partial view location issue has been resolved and all business category sections should now display correctly in both Add and Edit forms.
