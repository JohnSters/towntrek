### ðŸ”µ 6.2 Architecture Improvements
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: 6.1
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** (2025-08-17)

#### Tasks:
- [x] Reduce tight coupling in AnalyticsService
- [x] Implement event sourcing for analytics events
- [x] Add validation for analytics parameters
- [x] Create interfaces for better testability
- [x] Implement dependency injection improvements

#### âœ… **Completed Implementation:**
- **Service Separation**: Created separate services for different concerns:
  - `IAnalyticsDataService` and `AnalyticsDataService` - Handles all data access operations
  - `IAnalyticsValidationService` and `AnalyticsValidationService` - Handles parameter validation
  - `IAnalyticsEventService` and `AnalyticsEventService` - Handles event sourcing
- **Event Sourcing**: Implemented comprehensive event tracking system:
  - `AnalyticsEvent` model for storing all analytics-related events
  - Event types: BusinessView, AnalyticsAccess, AnalyticsExport, AnalyticsError
  - Automatic event recording with context (IP, user agent, platform, session)
  - Database table created and migration applied
- **Parameter Validation**: Created comprehensive validation service:
  - User ID validation with existence checks
  - Business ownership validation
  - Analytics days parameter validation (1-365 range)
  - Platform parameter validation (Web, Mobile, API, All)
  - Date range validation with bounds checking
  - Comparative analysis request validation
- **Dependency Injection**: Improved service registration:
  - All new services registered in DI container
  - Proper interface-based dependency injection
  - Reduced coupling between services
- **AnalyticsService Refactoring**: Updated main service to use new architecture:
  - Injected new services instead of direct database access
  - Added comprehensive error handling with event recording
  - Implemented validation before all operations
  - Added event tracking for all analytics operations
- **Database Integration**: Added AnalyticsEvents table to ApplicationDbContext
- **Compilation Error Resolution**: Successfully resolved all compilation errors:
  - Fixed missing properties in ViewModels (BusinessAnalyticsData, AnalyticsOverview, etc.)
  - Resolved type conversion issues (decimal to double, string to double)
  - Fixed array to list conversions for chart data
  - Corrected method calls to match interface definitions
  - Updated property names to match model definitions
  - Added missing helper methods for performance calculations
  - Replaced undefined constants with available alternatives
- **UI Integration**: Added analytics functionality to all dashboard pages:
  - Admin Dashboard: Added Analytics Monitoring quick action card
  - Admin Layout: Added Analytics Monitoring navigation section
  - Client Layout: Added Advanced Analytics navigation for non-trial users
  - Client Dashboard: Added Advanced Analytics quick action card
  - Analytics Dashboard: Added export and sharing buttons
  - Created AnalyticsMonitoring views (Dashboard, Performance, Errors, Usage)
  - Updated ClientDashboardViewModel with HasAdvancedAnalyticsAccess property
  - Updated ClientService to populate advanced analytics access

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Services are loosely coupled
- [x] Events are properly tracked
- [x] Validation is comprehensive
- [x] Code is highly testable
- [x] All compilation errors resolved
- [x] Project builds successfully
- [x] Analytics functionality integrated into all dashboard pages
