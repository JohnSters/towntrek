# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing TownTrek error handling system by adding database storage for critical errors and providing admin dashboard access to these error logs. The system will complement the existing file-based logging by storing important errors in the database for quick access, analysis, and resolution tracking through the admin interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want critical errors to be automatically saved to the database, so that I can quickly access and analyze system issues without parsing log files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a general exception occurs THEN the system SHALL save the error details to the database with severity level "Critical"
2. WHEN a 404 error occurs THEN the system SHALL save the error details to the database with severity level "Warning"
3. WHEN a 401 unauthorized error occurs THEN the system SHALL save the error details to the database with severity level "Error"
4. WHEN an argument validation error occurs THEN the system SHALL save the error details to the database with severity level "Error"
5. WHEN an API exception occurs THEN the system SHALL save the error details to the database with severity level "Critical"
6. WHEN saving an error to the database THEN the system SHALL capture timestamp, error type, message, stack trace, user context, request path, IP address, and user agent

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view error statistics on the admin dashboard, so that I can quickly assess system health and identify trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a stat card showing the count of unresolved critical errors from the last 24 hours
2. WHEN viewing the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display error trend information in the recent activity section
3. WHEN viewing error statistics THEN the system SHALL show counts by error type (Exception, 404, 401, Argument, API)
4. WHEN displaying error counts THEN the system SHALL differentiate between resolved and unresolved errors
5. IF there are more than 10 critical errors in the last 24 hours THEN the stat card SHALL display a warning indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to access a dedicated error management view from the admin dashboard, so that I can review, filter, and manage error logs efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on error-related elements in the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL navigate to a dedicated error logs view
2. WHEN viewing the error logs page THEN the system SHALL display errors in a paginated table format
3. WHEN viewing error logs THEN the system SHALL show timestamp, error type, message, affected user, severity, and resolution status
4. WHEN viewing error logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by error type, severity, date range, and resolution status
5. WHEN viewing error logs THEN the system SHALL provide search functionality by error message or user
6. WHEN viewing error logs THEN the system SHALL display the most recent errors first by default

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to mark errors as resolved and add resolution notes, so that I can track which issues have been addressed and maintain an audit trail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an error in the error logs THEN the system SHALL provide a "Mark as Resolved" action for unresolved errors
2. WHEN marking an error as resolved THEN the system SHALL prompt for optional resolution notes
3. WHEN marking an error as resolved THEN the system SHALL record the resolving administrator and timestamp
4. WHEN an error is marked as resolved THEN the system SHALL update the error status and exclude it from critical error counts
5. WHEN viewing resolved errors THEN the system SHALL display resolution information including who resolved it, when, and any notes
6. WHEN an error is resolved THEN the system SHALL allow unresolving it if needed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view detailed error information including stack traces and request context, so that I can effectively debug and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on an error in the error logs THEN the system SHALL display a detailed error view
2. WHEN viewing error details THEN the system SHALL show complete stack trace information
3. WHEN viewing error details THEN the system SHALL show request context including path, user agent, and IP address
4. WHEN viewing error details THEN the system SHALL show affected user information if available
5. WHEN viewing error details THEN the system SHALL provide options to copy error information for external analysis
6. IF the error has resolution notes THEN the system SHALL display them prominently in the detail view

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database error logging to integrate seamlessly with the existing error handling system, so that current functionality is preserved while adding new capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database error logging is implemented THEN the existing file-based logging SHALL continue to function unchanged
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log to both the file system and database without impacting application performance
3. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to log errors to files and not cause application failures
4. WHEN database logging fails THEN the system SHALL log the database logging failure to the file system
5. WHEN the system starts up THEN the database error logging SHALL initialize automatically without manual configuration
